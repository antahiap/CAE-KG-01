### Energy Graph Method

A simple undirected weighted network to connect simillar sim-sim


#### Graph Embedding
- Graph embedding, fail, compares two seprate graph and in energy graph, graph interconnection matter
- SubGNN, sounds a good idea with local and global feature, but code is not stable, hard to use torch-lightning to debug


**New Perspective**: 2 layer neural Network interpretation

###### [Introduction](https://hpi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/mueller/courses/graphmining/GraphMining-01-Introduction.pdf)
 
It should be a dynamic graph, but for now cosider it static
- if all parts are the same, the graph is isomorphism

###### [Link Prediction](https://hpi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/mueller/courses/graphmining/2017/05-LinkPrediction.pdf)
supervised Method 
-  Neighborhood-based, The	larger	the	overlap	of	the	neighbors	of	two	nodes,	the	more	likely	the	nodes	to	
be	linked	in	the	future. 

ideas:
- Influence propagation
- Link Prediction
  - unsupervised, Neighborhood based, link prediction on specific nodes
- Graph evolution
- Detecting frauds


#### To Do 
- [ ] Go through HPI material
- [ ] Imolement simple matrix
- [ ] look in the big Knowledge graph book
- [ ] [Networkx new algorithems](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/auto_examples/index.html)

### Shramana Inputs 
[link1]( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05584.pdf),[link2](http://snap.stanford.edu/proj/embeddings-www/), These two are very informative links on node embeddings that I got from Dr.Fr√∂hlich

[This](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2100/paper26.pdf) Property graph models

- Python package to use
    - [pypi-graphembedding](https://pypi.org/project/graphembedding/)
    - [karateclub](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/karateclub), Shramana

Start with karateclub and [nxneo4j](https://github.com/ybaktir/networkx-neo4j/blob/master/examples/nxneo4j_tutorial_latest.ipynb)
- update package `pip install karateclub --upgrade`
    - Neighbourhood-Based Node Level Embedding/DeepWalk
    - change edges to be indirected

    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59289134/constructing-networkx-graph-from-neo4j-query-result

- How to read fully connected graph
  - Use GDS to make the graph, not returning nodes, relationships in result
  - Use apoc.path.subgraph to get based on connectivity, didn't work
  - try to check connectivity with networkx
    - [Algorithms](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/approximation.html#module-networkx.algorithms.approximation.connectivity)
  - try to develop the cypher query

- visualize graph based on lable color
- graph embedding
- [ ] sort graph - layer graph

depend completely on whether the subgraph is heterogeneous or homogeneous (only one type of nodes and connections), Dr.Frohlich:  look into Graph Neural Networks specifically from the DGL Python Package. 
There are two major packages in python for Graph Neural Nets - pytorch geometric and DGL (https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.4.x/index.html)


shramana.thakur: needed algorithms for heterogeneous graph embeddings... so, graph neural nets

- [RGCN](https://paperswithcode.com/method/rgcn)


-------------------------------------

- [ ] add simulation connection
- [ ] embed fp3 based on status_parameter value
- [ ] look into dt instead of tn
- [ ] save intersting finding on neodash - find better viewing for graph
- [ ] consider termination time to exclude half run ex, fp3 57,95
