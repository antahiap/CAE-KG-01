## Graph Algorithems
Itentended to use inductive methods to extract knowledge. Observation from parts energy features and conclude platform charachteristics. Current Graph has limited connection between the parts. We assume parts with the same pid are refering to the same part. Later more nodes can be added to specify this more specifically.

- reverse part-Sim relation
- store energy features as a node
- add run name as just digit

### Questions
- [ ] important time step?
- [ ] simillar absorbtion, same values for features
