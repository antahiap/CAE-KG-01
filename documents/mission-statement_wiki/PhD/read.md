To read:
- Introduction to Graph Theory, by Richard J. Trudeau (Dover), is a very well writ-ten, gentle introduction.
- Introduction to Graph Theory, Fifth Ed., by Robin J. Wilson (Pearson), is a solid introduction with good illustrations.
- Graph Theory and Its Applications, Third Ed., by Jonathan L. Gross, Jay Yellen, and Mark Anderson (Chapman and Hall), assumes more mathematics background and provides more detail and exercises.
