##### Knowledge Graph
###### Load Path Detectionn
  - initial example, there is no component
<img src='uploads/4da5e41636f041ce786d32f99079d471/image.png' height=200\>

  - meeting with Jens Trilling, he can't add constrain to the model. I think it is best I do the modeling my self. 2-3 working day, then Axel contribution to the paper will be questioned.
<img src='uploads/af5eb46e24951b14685f462b7cdddcdb/image.png' height=200\>

###### Transfer DOE
  - hetrogenous training on the graph, works with Des, Part. issue with adding Sim. trying to find out the issue, problem was with not having any Sim node in the tail the hetroconv forward msg was failing to add the sim node to the node type for the embedding. Several option to solve it, 
    - multi dir on NRG_PART edge
    - re direct the graph structure that the sim is not only source.
    - predicted weights are making no sense
<img src='uploads/b4d22dfad31c1cac91db6899bf45782a/image.png' height=200\>

- hetrogenous node embedding, issue to set data for the training, its example wasn't following deepsnap. removing Des and Veh nodes. Des is taken care with part connettivity, model are common for different veh > pause hetero embedding idea, don't know how to do it unsupervised
- homogeneous node embedding, deepsnap example in pyg is also for suppervised
- started with the course workshops, using negative sampleing for unsuppervised, first result with onl nn.Embedding- no node feature

<img src='uploads/ed37127a54e798d47e7b53c6c12b2824/image.png' height=200\>

###### Ontology
- Deciding on the paper structure
  - focus on graph modeling
  - reviewing available ontology and connecting to our prefered one
  - two usecase of our modeling, EuroNCAP and CAE data
- Realized intro should start from domain, struggle to find out a good reference for CAE history in automotive industry
- Introduction 70% done

##### CAE_NLP
- Ganish, 
- done with dynamic visualization of Babelnet, with plotly graph objects

##### CAE_WEB

  - done with developing filtering, started with upperleg visualization.
  - react web component, error
  - investigating veu.js
<img src='uploads/e4cc6e40530b008ab288380629c5ceea/image.png' height=200\>

##### Other
- Venza model for weld, 
  - model is runing with duplicate solids
  - ansa duplicate doesn't find the solids
  - used paste node features, withing for feedback 

##### Test Pic CNN
- Struggle with Ava thesis,
  - post poning the meeting to get feedback from his suppervisor
  - refusing to implement feddback from my side, the application is not well defined. 

##### TO DO
