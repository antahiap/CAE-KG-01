- Ganish feels disappointed with NLP struggles (not having result)
- identify safety companion pdf structure and generating small replaceable example of it
- He is tired of not finding what he needs, I should split his tasks and do a bit of parallel searching with him

##### Crash test-CNN
- Draft Proposal, in 2 weeks 1st review, the target is to be done in a month
- Cats-Dogs CNN example test
- Update the thesis timeline under her student wiki
- 30% code- 70% writing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Knowledge Graph
- SubGNN, the problem with torch-lightning, gets an error when it is trying to run on multi GPU, it is running on CPU. the article is interesting but doesn't know if it is good to go with a code that has this much trouble.
- Looking into link prediction instead of subgraph embedding. Common neighbor and simrank consider the structure of shared neighbor. need to adjust networkx functions to consider weighted graph. 



##### Other
- uploaded crashworthiness book, [link](https://gitlab.scai.fraunhofer.de/ndv/research/automotive/automotive-research/-/blob/master/crash/vehicle_crashworthiness_complete.pdf)


##### CAE_WEB
- Alex needed to delay the meeting since he didn't have time to work on our project
- Ava, still working on the backend model, has a problem understanding the model.


##### CAE_NLP
- Ganish, couldn't find a package to extract picture captions, provided him the idea to combine picture and text extraction and found a paper in bio for this, [link  ](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/21/4381/5428177), but this is working with fig tag, safety companion doesn't have that and it can't extract sketches. 
- Meeting with Angelina and intern regarding NLP, shared some ideas. will have a follow-up meeting in May
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Knowledge Graph
- Sub-graph embedding, mostly looking into community detection and not consider subgraph connection for similarity. 
- [SubGNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10538) can be a possibility
- need more input 

##### CAE_WEB
- Defining four classes on neo4j (Sim, Model, Barrier/Impactor)
- Status value view initial request is too complicated, Alex will look more in react-elastic-elastic-table and plotly
- submitted the [CAE_WEB proposal](https://gitlab.scai.fraunhofer.de/anahita.pakiman/mission-statement/-/blob/master/proposals/nafem_cae_web__1_.pdf) for NAFEMs.

##### Other
