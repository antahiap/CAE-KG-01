- Simple graph, multigraph, Pseudograph(node can loop back to itself)
- **Random**(no hierarchies. This type of shapeless graph is “flat” with no discernible pat-terns. All nodes have the same probability of being attached to any other node.), **small-world**(mostly with a small group of friends, you’re never many hops away from anyone else—even if they are a famous actor or on the other side hops away from anyone else—even if they are a famous actor or on the other side of the planet.), **scale-free structure**(power-law distributions and a hub-and-spoke architecture is preserved regardless of scale, such as in the World
A scale-free network is produced when there are power-law distributions and a hub-and-spoke architecture is preserved regardless of scale, such as in the World Wide Web.)
- connected vs disconnected
- weighted vs unweighted
- directed vs undirected
- cyclic vs acyclic
- sparse vs dense
- Monopartite, bipartite, and k- partite

**Algorithms**
- Pathfinding, 
  - shortest path, average shortest path( The shortest path is the traversal route with the fewest hops or lowest weight. If the graph is directed, then it’s the shortest path between two nodes as allowed by the relationship directions)
  - longest path, diameter of a graph
- Centerality
- community Detection
