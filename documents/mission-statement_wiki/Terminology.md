Knowledge-based engineering 

Reliability
 - the ability of equipment to function without failure

Robustness
 - Robustness is the state where the technology, product, or process performance is minimally sensitive to factors causing variability (either in the manufacturing or users environment) and aging at the lowest unit manufacturing cost

Stability
 - The stable solution time step, Δ t {\displaystyle \Delta t} \Delta t, is limited for numerical stability, as expressed by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition (CFL)


Method
- [Wasserstein metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric)
